Triangle Tracker

Description:
This is an Application with a Triangle Tracker that is easy to use and navigate through so that the user will be allowed to enter three sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is Equilateral,Isoscles,Scalene or not a triangle.However, It will not allow users to input non-numerical values.


Languages used:
HTML
Javascript

BDD:
This application is therefore expected to work like this below:

1. should be able to display a space bar for the input of numbers by the user.
2. should be able to display a calculate and  refresh function.
3. should the user enter values that are all equal - The result should be "Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal".
4. should the user enter two equal sides - The result should be "Isosceles triangle: Two sides are equal"
5. should the user enter values that aren't equal - The result should be "Scalene: No sides are equal"

Should the user enter values that cannot even make triangle, the the result will be "Not a triangle"
